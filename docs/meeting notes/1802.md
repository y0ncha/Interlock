# Meeting Summary – 18/02

## Discussion Points

The discussion focused on clarifying the core value proposition we want to prioritize and define clearly. We examined whether:

- **System integrations** should be implemented internally, giving us full control over connectors and data flow, or
- We should rely on the **agent's ability to search** within relevant context, limiting our responsibility to guiding and constraining how it retrieves that context

We also discussed how the dialogue with the agent should be structured, including the level of user involvement in the workflow:

- Whether the user should intervene only in cases of errors or missing information, or
- At every transition between major steps

Another key topic was how to incorporate **code validation** into the process:

- Either by introducing an additional LLM acting as a judge, or
- By assigning the current agent the responsibility of generating and executing tests, potentially adopting a TDD-style approach where tests are created before executing the plan

## Action Items

- [ ] Complete and upload the high-level project design document to the GitHub repository
